## prediction markets
Resolve the price at the probability settled by prediction market. 
Trade on the probability that some event occurs. Feel free to multiply the
number by 10 if you want to increase the numebrs a bit (i.e. bet on permille instead of percents)

These can get pretty silly and are a lot of fun.
